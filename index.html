        <p>Originally from Norway, I moved to Calgary, Canada, in 2005 and quickly grew to love the local tuner car scene. My passion for cars initially led me to work at Top Gear Car Wash, where working closely with the business owner sparked my interest in entrepreneurship. Over the past two years, I have gained experience as a freelance web designer. I am enhancing my skills through the web designer. I am enhancing my skills through the Web Design and Development program at SAIT to build a solid foundation for my career.</p>
